%-----------PROJECTS-----------------
\section{Selected Projects}
  \resumeSubHeadingListStart
    \resumeSubItem{Kinect Acoustic Localization and Activity Detection}
      {Real-time Kinect human skeletal tracking data was used to develop location based acoustic activity detection models. Sound direction-of-arrival was used to detect sound source among multiple human and machine sources. Location aware models for Speech Recognition using CMUSphinx tool and Speaker Identification using GMM models were developed. Work submitted to UbiComp '19.}
    \resumeSubItem{Smartphone Speaker Identification} {The collaborative speaker identification app exchanged training data among neighboring phones over Bluetooth to make and update event driven dynamic logistic regression classifiers. Built with Android and Weka toolkit. Published in EWSN '15.}
    \resumeSubItem{Test Strategy Optimization} {Developer and database designer for a software tool for test strategy optimization for various Intel products for Intel's internal usage. Used mathematical models (linear/quadratic regression) for predicting product DPM (defect per million). Developed with C\#, SQL server and syncfusion framework.}
    \resumeSubItem{Temperature Chamber Device Testing} {Wrote offline data analysis scripts for data collected from a temperature chamber for stress testing of a Intel device. The script was later widely used by the Intel team for several subsequent phases of data collection and analysis on device channel failure behavior. }
    \resumeSubItem{Step Detection with Inertial Sensors in Shoes} {Time series data from footsteps of various speed was collected by implanting a tri-axis accelerometer in a shoe. A dynamic threshold based algorithm was developed to infer footsteps from the sensor data which is adpative to different walking and running speeds. Work was accepted to be filed as a patent for Intel Corporation. }
    \resumeSubItem{Mood Detection from Speech for Distant Sources}
      {A set of distance agnostic speech features were experimentally found by their distortions to various distances and their f-scores for emotion detection. These features were used to train a SVM classifier for various mood detection from a public mood dataset (EmoDB). Synthetic reverberation were artificially added to the training data from a room impulse response simulator from the room's physical properties. Published in MobiQuitous '17.}
      
    \resumeSubItem{LAN Messenger}
      {Physical layer built using null modem, peer to peer data transmission with framing, flow control, error control using stop-wait protocol and CRC, network topology build-up and data transmission from one network to another using Link State Routing. Implemented with Java. }
    \resumeSubItem{Microcontroller Based Wireless Motorcar with Speed Control}
      {Using Atmel microcontroller platform and C, a PC controlled motor car was built. One-way communication protocol was implemented through a pair of 433 MHz radio transmitter-receiver. Speed control was handled using pulse-width modulation. }
    \resumeSubItem{Hardware Design Using Xilinx FPGA }
      {Sequential multiplier, VGA, pong video game, a simple processor. }
     \resumeSubItem{GPU Performance Benchmarking}
      {NVIDIA GEForce GTX 400 GPU performance benchmarking for k-means clustering, matrix multiplication and salt-pepper noise reduction from images. }
